										Martins Ejike and Stephanie Ulogwara, the founders of GradNav, share a common passion for empowering
                                        Irish students and bridging the gap between education and career success. Their journey began during 
                                        their Leaving Certificate in 2020, where they both encountered the daunting task of choosing Irish courses 
                                        and navigating the uncertain terrain of post-graduation prospects in Ireland. Fueled by their own experiences 
                                        and the desire to make a difference, Martins and Stephanie embarked on a mission to create GradNavâ€”a 
                                        platform that would provide Irish students with the guidance and support they wish they had during their own 
                                        educational journey. With their combined expertise and dedication, Martins and Stephanie are committed 
                                        to helping Irish students across Ireland embark on their academic and Irish career paths with clarity, confidence, and purpose.
