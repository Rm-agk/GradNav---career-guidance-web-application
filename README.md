**GradNav Overview**

GradNav is a web application designed to guide students in Ireland through their career and educational paths. Fueled by our own experiences of last-minute decisions during the CAO process, we developed GradNav to offer students personalised career pathways and course recommendations.

**Features:**

Personalised Recommendations: Users input their subjects, skills, character traits, hobbies, wants, needs, and background, which are processed using a large language model (GPT-3.5-turbo) to generate specific course and career suggestions.
Detailed Information: Each recommended course comes with comprehensive details including CAO points, potential salaries, university options, and accommodation possibilities.
Interactive Elements: The app includes 55 career-specific quizzes and a popular careers section updated based on user activity, providing insights into various educational paths.
In-App Support: A chatbot powered by GPT-3.5-turbo answers queries, offering a deeper understanding of the recommendations and helping to navigate complex choices.
Goal:
GradNav aims to reduce the anxiety and uncertainty students face by providing clear, focused, and actionable advice. Our app goes beyond generic suggestions by providing contextually rich guidance tailored to each user's unique profile.

**Motivation:**

Our motivation is rooted in a desire to prevent students from misdirecting their educational efforts and to support the discovery of courses that truly match their personal and career aspirations. By integrating advanced AI and comprehensive data, GradNav serves as an all-in-one tool that simplifies the decision-making process, helping to maintain an educated workforce and empowering students with the confidence to make informed decisions about their future.
